## How to load the towerWaterUse package

To load the `towerWaterUse` package the user must use a method that installs R-packages from [GitHub](https://github.com/) like `remotes::install_github()`.  The `remotes` package must be installed first and then the `towerWaterUse` package using the code below.  Note that the `subdir` argument is necessary to load this package using `remotes::install_github()`.  This is a one-time process for each version of R or version of the `towerWaterUse` package.  After the `towerWaterUse` package is installed, you can use it like any other R-package with `library(towerWaterUse)`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#install the remotes package (one-time process)
install.packages("remotes")

#install the towerWaterUse package (one-time process)
remotes::install_github(repo="https://github.com/rniswon/Thermoelectric",
                        subdir="towerWaterUse",build_vignettes = T,upgrade = "never")

#load the towerWaterUse package (necessary each time the package is used in a given R session)
library(towerWaterUse)
```

When the `towerWaterUse` package is installed, all dependency packages above will be installed and the process will take a few minutes, but once the package is installed all dependencies will load with `library(towerWaterUse)`.
