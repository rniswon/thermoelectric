      <abstract>This dataset presents water withdrawal estimates, consumption estimates, and associated information for 1,122 water-using, utility-scale thermoelectric power plants in the United States for 2015. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed models to estimate thermoelectric water use based on linked heat-and-water budgets, including thermodynamically plausible ranges of minimum and maximum withdrawal and consumption, to provide a consistent method for water-use estimation across the fleet of U.S. thermoelectric plants.  Historically, thermoelectric water withdrawal and consumption has been estimated by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) based on surveys of plant operator-reported data, and the USGS's 5-year water-use reports based on compiling data from State water agencies, plant operators, and the EIA. The USGS models provide independent estimates from plant operator-reported data. The total estimated withdrawal for 2015 was about 103 billion gallons per day (Bgal/d), and total estimated consumption was about 2.7 Bgal/d.  This data release supports the findings published in Harris and Diehl (2019).</abstract>
      <purpose>The need for reliable estimates of the amount of water withdrawn and consumed by thermoelectric power plants is garnering increased attention due to the Nation’s growing demand for water and energy. Water withdrawals for thermoelectric power generation are the largest category of water withdrawals in the United States (Dieter and others, 2018), and water consumption represents a small but substantial share of total U.S. water consumption especially at smaller spatial scales (i.e., watersheds, counties). Reported and estimated thermoelectric water withdrawals and consumption vary among Federal datasets.  The USGS models provide independent estimates from plant operator-reported data and a consistent method for estimating water use across the fleet of U.S. thermoelectric plants.</purpose>

            <edomvd>A cooling system in which fresh water is withdrawn from a LAKE to condense the steam used to generate electricity and that discharges the water back to a LAKE at a higher temperature. Lakes were distinguished from ponds as having irregular, natural shorelines, and enough inflow to compensate for evaporation.  Please note that for some plants with this model type designation the water source may indicate a river (e.g., Tennessee River).  For all cases, these plants are located on reservoirs that have been constructed along the stream reach of these large rivers.</edomvd>

        <attrlabl>PERCENT_CD_ALLOCATION</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>The percentage of condenser duty (CD) (the amount of waste heat delivered to the cooling system through the condenser) that is allocated to the cooling system.  Most boiler-generator-cooling system associations at thermoelectric power plants result in 100 percent CD allocation to cooling systems.  However, there are 46 COMPLEX "COOLING_TYPE" plants that have more than one type of cooling system located on a single boiler-generator-cooling system association group.  For those plants, the CD was allocated between the two cooling models using professional judgement (for example, at plant ID 46, 80 percent of the CD was allocated to the once-through lake cooling model and 20 percent to the recirculating tower model).  Additionally, for plants with single boiler-generator-cooling system association groups, 100 percent of the CD was allocated to each of the cooling system types (for example, at plant ID 46, 100 percent of the CD was allocated to the once-through lake cooling model and 100 percent to the recirculating tower model).  This results in the minimum and maximum withdrawal and consumption estimates at single boiler-generator-cooling system association groups, where the maximum withdrawal and minimum consumption is associated with the once-through system, and the minimum withdrawal and maximum consumption is associated with the recirculating cooling system.</attrdef>
